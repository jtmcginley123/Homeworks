# Mortgage/Real Estate domain in FinTech
# How Z has Shook the Industry

## Overview and Origin:

* Company Name: 
    * Zillow Group, Incorporated (Z) or just Zillow

* When was the company incorporated?
    * Zillow was founded in December of 2004 in Seattle, Washington, USA.

* Who are the founders of the company?
    * The founders of Zillow Group, Inc. are Lloyd Frink and Richard Barton. Lloyd Frink is currently the Executive Chairman of the Company. Richard Barton was the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for Zillow until 2010. He then moved into the position of Executive Chairman. In 2019, Barton returned to CEO and is still currently in this role. Both of these men have had tenure at Microsoft and were involved in endeavors such as MS-DOS 5 and 6, Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 operating systems. Richard Barton founded Expedia as well as Glassdoor and Lloyd Frink was the Senior Vice President of Supplier Relations. Expedia was founded in October 1996 as a division of Microsoft and was purchased and is currently owned by InterActiveCorp.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    * Zillow started out just as a website for homeowners to list the properties they were trying to sell or rent. They gave power to the homeowners to make sure they are getting a fair price for the home they are selling. This platform has obviously transformed and evolved over the past 15, going on 16 years the company has been successfully operating. Zillow now is a platform that real estate agents and landlords can purchase leads. The Company also incorporated buying and selling houses directly on its platform, taking out most of the middle-man aspect. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    * The company originally made its money from advertising the homes that people were trying to sell. They evolved that into selling leads to real estate agents and landlords who were in business. The more the agent or landlord pays, the higher they are on the list to be seen. Zillow went public in 2011 with an Initial Public Offering (IPO) at $20 per share. This gave the comapny valuation of about $540 million. They began trading on the NASDAQ:Z on July 20, 2011. When the Company initially did its Form S-1 filing, they did not release the number of shares to be sold or the price per share that was planned. 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    * The main issue Zillow is trying to solve is the restricted access to information about home values. Though these numbers are not secret, before Zillow they were much more difficult to get a hold of. Zillow has made this information available. Zillow gave the population access to information about houses for sale, for rent, and for those not currently on the market. The Company uses active data from multiple different sources and made it available to those who are trying to sell or rent their home, making sure they are getting an appropriate price for the true value of their home. This would be under the Zestimate which is updated everyday for over 100 million homes. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    * Zillow's intended customer is anyone who is trying sell, rent, or buy a home. This an extremely wide customer base because everyone needs shelter. As of January 2020, Zillow had 36 million website visits in comparison to Trulia (another ZillowGroup Company) which had 23 million and Yahoo! Homes which had 20 million website visits. One thing that sets Zillow apart from their competitors is that on their platform someone can sell their house and buy or rent another one in the same place. They know that this is extremely attractive to those who are interested doing both, selling and buying a home, because according to the 2019 Zillow Group Consumer Housing Trends Report, almost two-thirds of sellers are buying at the same time and of those looking to buy, half are considering renting as an option. Zillow has made sure that their platform is a one-stop-shop, which they beat their competitors to by a longshot. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    * Zillow currently uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to compute their Zestimates that are considered to be fair and unbiased estimates on the home or apartment that is set to be listed. The Company incorporated AI that will analyze photos and scans of the property to actually 'see' the value in the home. They found the people to do this long awaited job in the 'Zillow Prize' competition aimed at improving this useful, but not perfect feature. The goal is for the Zestimate feature to think like the human brain and consider what people find attractive or appealing in a home. This is revolutionary because it does not just consider the facts and features of the home but also the quality of its build and the literal curb appeal. 
    * Zillow also uses training models to detect the construction of the home. Zillow Floor Plan allows panoramic photographs to be taken and Zillow Floor Plan will analyze them and construct a floor plan image to be added to the listing, this makes it easier for buyers to know what the home has to offer before they even fully consider going to an open house or private showing. 
    * Zillow uses click stream data to analyze what is attractive to each individual Zillow user. This is a type of machine learning that will allow Zillow to give recommendation to its users based on similarities between each of the properties that they have looked at and/or favorited. They continuously improve the process used when analyzing this data in order to make it most efficient and take up the least amount of storage. 
    * They have shifted from storing their data in Microsoft's SQL Server and using in-house caching techniques to event streaming when they needs to view their data. They use Amazon Kinesis Firehose and Amazon S3. 
    * This is just a few of these technologies which Zillow are currently using along with many more but I found that these were the most important. These technologies are making Zillow stand apart from its competitors.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    * Zillow is in the Mortgage/Real Estate domain of the Financial Industry. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    * The major trends and innovations of the Mortgage/Real Estate domain over the last 5-10 years include: 
        * One of the most important trends of the Mortgage/Real Estate domain is that the internet is not replacing real estate agents. This is something that could change in the next 5 to 10 years because of platforms like Zillow and Trulia. In the last 5 to 10 years, buyers and sellers have increasingly used the internet to assist their home searches but it has not decreased the use of real estate agents in a significant maner. 
        * Home searches are taking longer due to the fact that there is a tighter inventory. The length it took a buyer to find a home used to be seven to eight weeks up until 2007. The time to find a home now has risen in average to 10 weeks. 
        * One of the major innovations that has been incorporated into the Mortgage/Real Estate domain is the use of Artificial Intelligence, which I touched on earlier in the document. This is something that will continue to play a part of the companies that have online platforms because AI is used to analyze consumer data and preferences.
        * Virtual Reality (VR) is an innovation that is currently happening but is still up and coming. This is something that architects are incorporating into the building process of custom homes. Soon it will be an option for any home you are lookig at, whether it is to custom build or to buy. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
    * Some of Zillow's competitors include Redfin, Realtor.com, HotPads and Trulia. However Trulia and HotPads have been acquired by ZillowGroup but are still seperate entities. 


## Results:

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    * The impact of Zillow has been rattling. Zillow revolutionized how Agent and Landlords found their leads. Zillow made it much easier for someone to sell their home and for someone buying a home to see their options. Zillow has creeped into the Mortgage domain and has removed the middle-man and allowed for the seller to have more control and less hassle when having a potential buyer. There is definitely more trick that Zillow has in their future plans playbook that I am sure we will see soon. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
    * The key metric that seems most important that Zillow uses is the number of unique monthly visitors. Zillow is up to 36 million unique visitors per month as of January 2020. 
    * Zillow also uses Agent Productivity to measure how successful they are as a company. Hopefully, if the agents are successful, the company that they work for are successful as well. 
    * Zillow's data base quality is something that they take pride in and speak a lot about in their literature. Zillow has their data bases updated daily to make sure that the information they are providing to their users is as accurate as they can give. 
    * As most companies do, Customer Satisfaction is one of the main factors that defines success. This is something that Zillow takes seriously and has tried to give their customers and users the most information and help to make their buying and selling process go smoothly. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    * Zillow, relative to its competitors, is doing well. Zillow is for buyers, renters, sellers, finding agents and finding mortgage lenders. Realtor.com also provides these options but is licensed from the National Association of REALTORS, this could be slightly more attractive to someone who had a bad experience in the past with the trustworthiness of their realtor, buyer or seller. Their other competitors are Redfin, Trulia, and MLS but these competitors do not have all of the same products that Zillow has to offer. In regards to where they stand on a numerical basis, they are number 1 at the moment and they continue to keep this standard. 


## Recommendations:

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    * Zillow should not stop improving. The comapny has had this momentum of progress and evolution that has been seen over the past 15, going on 16 years. If Zillow continues to keep this type of drive going is important. This may seem far fetched but if Zillow was able to implement the Virtual Reality aspect into viewing homes on their platform, that would be very revolutionary to homeviewings. This is something that could be in the works because of how COVID has impacted our ability to interact in person with one another. This is not something that any competitor of Zillow offers but this is something that custom home builders have been starting to offer. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    * If Zillow were to offer this service into their line, it would add a more interactive experience for their users. This would set Zillow apart from their competitors. Some may not see this as a good idea or that it could be beneficial but sometimes a company has to take a reach. This would prevent them with having any set backs with thier Agent Productivity because their customers would still be able to be in touch with their agent but also be able to view their potential home from the comfort of their own house or meeting at their agents office to do the VR tour.  

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    * The addition of this service would require the ability of taking panoramic pictures and/or video to make the experience as realistic as possible. If it does not look good or does not portray the property accurately that could end up with an unhappy customer. This is service that would take a decent amount an effort to accomplish but it would be worth it if we go through something like COVID again. Truly, I am not sure of what other technologies would go into creating this but I am sure there are others that would be required. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    * Without the VR technologies, this idea would not be able to be accomplished so it is appropriate.
